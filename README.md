## ME

My name is zhangshuhan.

A coder, likes to toss some technology, is still working + studying hard, and often records something in my personal blog, such as: programming notes or reading notes, etc., as long as I am interested, I will write it down. It can be regarded as increasing their own knowledge. ðŸ“–

My hobbies are games and music, and my favorite singer is Xu Song.

This is my [blog: https://imzsh.com](https://imzsh.com). I am still practicing my writing and I like to record.

My email address is shuxhan@163.com, welcome to discuss some technical issues with me, or if you want to talk about life with me, itâ€™s okay. ðŸ’¬
